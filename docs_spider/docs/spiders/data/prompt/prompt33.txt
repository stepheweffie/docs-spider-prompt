As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields. For example, the floating_ips field is now the reserved_ips field. The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being permanently deprecated.
