As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields. For example, the floating_ips field is now the reserved_ips field. The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the Projects API, we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API where the floating_ip field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response will contain the field reserved_ips in addition to the floating_ips field. Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be mapped to one of your Droplets. They can be used to create highly available setups or other configurations requiring movable addresses.

Reserved IPs are bound to a specific region.

To list all of the reserved IPs available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/reserved_ips.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called reserved_ips. This will be set to an array of reserved IP objects, each of which will contain the standard reserved IP attributes

On creation, a reserved IP must be either assigned to a Droplet or reserved to a region.

To create a new reserved IP assigned to a Droplet, send a POST request to /v2/reserved_ips with the droplet_id attribute.

To create a new reserved IP reserved to a region, send a POST request to /v2/reserved_ips with the region attribute.

Note: In addition to the standard rate limiting, only 12 reserved IPs may be created per 60 seconds.

The ID of the Droplet that the reserved IP will be assigned to.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called reserved_ip. The value of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes associated with a reserved IP. When assigning a reserved IP to a Droplet at same time as it created, the response's links object will contain links to both the Droplet and the assignment action. The latter can be used to check the status of the action.

To show information about a reserved IP, send a GET request to /v2/reserved_ips/$RESERVED_IP_ADDR.

The sizes objects represent different packages of hardware resources that can be used for Droplets. When a Droplet is created, a size must be selected so that the correct resources can be allocated.

Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs, disk space, and transfer. The size object also includes the pricing details and the regions that the size is available in.

To list all of available Droplet sizes, send a GET request to /v2/sizes. The response will be a JSON object with a key called sizes. The value of this will be an array of size objects each of which contain the standard size attributes.
