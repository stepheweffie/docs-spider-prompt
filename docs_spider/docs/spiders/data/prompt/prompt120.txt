The billing endpoints allow you to retrieve your account balance, invoices and billing history.

Balance: By sending requests to the /v2/customers/my/balance endpoint, you can retrieve the balance information for the requested customer account.

Invoices: Invoices are generated on the first of each month for every DigitalOcean customer. An invoice preview is generated daily, which can be accessed with the preview keyword in place of $INVOICE_UUID. To interact with invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at /v2/customers/my/invoices.

Billing History: Billing history is a record of billing events for your account. For example, entries may include events like payments made, invoices issued, or credits granted.
