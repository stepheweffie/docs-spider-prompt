How many nodes the load balancer contains. Each additional node increases the load balancer's ability to manage more connections. Load balancers can be scaled up or down, and you can change the number of nodes after creation up to once per hour. This field is currently not available in the AMS2, NYC2, or SFO1 regions. Use the size field to scale load balancers that reside in these regions.

This field has been replaced by the size_unit field for all regions except in AMS2, NYC2, and SFO1. Each available load balancer size now equates to the load balancer having a set number of nodes.
