A string specifying the UUID of the VPC to which the Kubernetes cluster is assigned.

An array of tags applied to the Kubernetes cluster. All clusters are automatically tagged k8s and k8s:$K8S_CLUSTER_ID.

An object specifying the details of the worker nodes available to the Kubernetes cluster.

An object specifying the maintenance window policy for the Kubernetes cluster.

A boolean value indicating whether the cluster will be automatically upgraded to new patch releases during its maintenance window.

A boolean value indicating whether surge upgrade is enabled/disabled for the cluster. Surge upgrade makes cluster upgrades fast and reliable by bringing up new nodes before destroying the outdated nodes.

A boolean value indicating whether the control plane is run in a highly available configuration in the cluster. Highly available control planes incur less downtime. The property cannot be disabled.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called kubernetes_cluster. The value of this will be an object containing the standard attributes of a Kubernetes cluster.

The IP address and cluster API server endpoint will not be available until the cluster has finished provisioning. The initial value of the cluster's status.state attribute will be provisioning. When the cluster is ready, this will transition to running.
