To update the name of a node pool, edit the tags applied to it, or adjust its number of nodes, send a PUT request to /v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/node_pools/$NODE_POOL_ID with the following attributes.

A unique ID that can be used to reference a Kubernetes cluster.

A unique ID that can be used to reference a Kubernetes node pool.

A human-readable name for the node pool.

The number of Droplet instances in the node pool.

An array containing the tags applied to the node pool. All node pools are automatically tagged k8s, k8s-worker, and k8s:$K8S_CLUSTER_ID.

An object of key/value mappings specifying labels to apply to all nodes in a pool. Labels will automatically be applied to all existing nodes and any subsequent nodes added to the pool. Note that when a label is removed, it is not deleted from the nodes in the pool.

An array of taints to apply to all nodes in a pool. Taints will automatically be applied to all existing nodes and any subsequent nodes added to the pool. When a taint is removed, it is deleted from all nodes in the pool.

A boolean value indicating whether auto-scaling is enabled for this node pool.

The minimum number of nodes that this node pool can be auto-scaled to. The value will be 0 if auto_scale is set to false.

The maximum number of nodes that this node pool can be auto-scaled to. The value will be 0 if auto_scale is set to false.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called node_pool. The value of this will be an object containing the standard attributes of a node pool.

To delete a single node in a pool, send a DELETE request to /v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/node_pools/$NODE_POOL_ID/nodes/$NODE_ID.

Appending the skip_drain=1 query parameter to the request causes node draining to be skipped. Omitting the query parameter or setting its value to 0 carries out draining prior to deletion.

Appending the replace=1 query parameter to the request causes the node to be replaced by a new one after deletion. Omitting the query parameter or setting its value to 0 deletes without replacement.

A unique ID that can be used to reference a Kubernetes node pool.

A unique ID that can be used to reference a node in a Kubernetes node pool.

Specifies whether or not to drain workloads from a node before it is deleted. Setting it to 1 causes node draining to be skipped. Omitting the query parameter or setting its value to 0 carries out draining prior to deletion.
