To destroy a Droplet along with a sub-set of its associated resources, send a DELETE request to the /v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/destroy_with_associated_resources/selective endpoint. The JSON body of the request should include reserved_ips, snapshots, volumes, or volume_snapshots keys each set to an array of IDs for the associated resources to be destroyed. The IDs can be found by querying the Droplet's associated resources. Any associated resource not included in the request will remain and continue to accrue changes on your account.

A successful response will include a 202 response code and no content. Use the status endpoint to check on the success or failure of the destruction of the individual resources.
