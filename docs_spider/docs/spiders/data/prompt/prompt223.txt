As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields. For example, the floating_ips field is now the reserved_ips field. The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the Projects API, we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API where the floating_ip field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response will contain the field reserved_ips in addition to the floating_ips field. Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

Floating IP actions are commands that can be given to a DigitalOcean floating IP. These requests are made on the actions endpoint of a specific floating IP.

An action object is returned. These objects hold the current status of the requested action.

To retrieve all actions that have been executed on a floating IP, send a GET request to /v2/floating_ips/$FLOATING_IP/actions.

A floating IP address.

The results will be returned as a JSON object with an actions key. This will be set to an array filled with action objects containing the standard floating IP action attributes.
