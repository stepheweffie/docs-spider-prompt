To create a new volume, send a POST request to /v2/volumes. Optionally, a filesystem_type attribute may be provided in order to automatically format the volume's filesystem. Pre-formatted volumes are automatically mounted when attached to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018. Attaching pre-formatted volumes to Droplets without support for auto-mounting is not recommended.

Attaching pre-formatted volumes to other Droplets is not recommended.

The slug identifier for the region where the resource will initially be available.
