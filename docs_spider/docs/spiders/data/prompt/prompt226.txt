A DigitalOcean image can be used to create a Droplet and may come in a number of flavors. Currently, there are five types of images: snapshots, backups, applications, distributions, and custom images.

Snapshots provide a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.

Backups are similar to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when enabled for a Droplet.

Custom images are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.
