Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs, disk space, and transfer. The size object also includes the pricing details and the regions that the size is available in.

To list all of available Droplet sizes, send a GET request to /v2/sizes. The response will be a JSON object with a key called sizes. The value of this will be an array of size objects each of which contain the standard size attributes.

Snapshots are saved instances of a Droplet or a block storage volume, which is reflected in the resource_type attribute. In order to avoid problems with compressing filesystems, each defines a min_disk_size attribute which is the minimum size of the Droplet or volume disk when creating a new resource from the saved snapshot.

To interact with snapshots, you will generally send requests to the snapshots endpoint at /v2/snapshots.

To list all of the snapshots available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/snapshots.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called snapshots. This will be set to an array of snapshot objects, each of which will contain the standard snapshot attributes.

It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.

To retrieve only snapshots based on Droplets, include the resource_type query parameter set to droplet. For example, /v2/snapshots?resource_type=droplet.

To retrieve only snapshots based on volumes, include the resource_type query parameter set to volume. For example, /v2/snapshots?resource_type=volume.

To retrieve information about a snapshot, send a GET request to /v2/snapshots/$SNAPSHOT_ID.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called snapshot. The value of this will be an snapshot object containing the standard snapshot attributes.

Either the ID of an existing snapshot. This will be an integer for a Droplet snapshot or a string for a volume snapshot.

Both Droplet and volume snapshots are managed through the /v2/snapshots/ endpoint. To delete a snapshot, send a DELETE request to /v2/snapshots/$SNAPSHOT_ID.

A status of 204 will be given. This indicates that the request was processed successfully, but that no response body is needed.

Either the ID of an existing snapshot. This will be an integer for a Droplet snapshot or a string for a volume snapshot.

Manage SSH keys available on your account.

To list all of the keys in your account, send a GET request to /v2/account/keys. The response will be a JSON object with a key set to ssh_keys. The value of this will be an array of ssh_key objects, each of which contains the standard ssh_key attributes.
