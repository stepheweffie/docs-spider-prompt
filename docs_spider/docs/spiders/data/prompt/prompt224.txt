To initiate an action on a floating IP send a POST request to /v2/floating_ips/$FLOATING_IP/actions. In the JSON body to the request, set the type attribute to on of the supported action types:

A floating IP address.

The type attribute set in the request body will specify the action that will be taken on the floating IP.

The type of action to initiate for the floating IP.

The response will be an object with a key called action. The value of this will be an object that contains the standard floating IP action attributes.

As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields. For example, the floating_ips field is now the reserved_ips field. The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the Projects API, we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API where the floating_ip field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response will contain the field reserved_ips in addition to the floating_ips field. Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

DigitalOcean Floating IPs are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be mapped to one of your Droplets. They can be used to create highly available setups or other configurations requiring movable addresses.

Floating IPs are bound to a specific region.

To list all of the floating IPs available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/floating_ips.

Which 'page' of paginated results to return.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called floating_ips. This will be set to an array of floating IP objects, each of which will contain the standard floating IP attributes

On creation, a floating IP must be either assigned to a Droplet or reserved to a region.

To create a new floating IP assigned to a Droplet, send a POST request to /v2/floating_ips with the droplet_id attribute.

To create a new floating IP reserved to a region, send a POST request to /v2/floating_ips with the region attribute.

Note: In addition to the standard rate limiting, only 12 floating IPs may be created per 60 seconds.

The ID of the Droplet that the floating IP will be assigned to.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called floating_ip. The value of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes associated with a floating IP. When assigning a floating IP to a Droplet at same time as it created, the response's links object will contain links to both the Droplet and the assignment action. The latter can be used to check the status of the action.
