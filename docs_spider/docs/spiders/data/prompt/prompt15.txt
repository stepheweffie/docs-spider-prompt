By default, the returned credentials have read-only access to your registry and cannot be used to push images. This is appropriate for most Kubernetes clusters. To retrieve read/write credentials, suitable for use with the Docker client or in a CI system, read_write may be provided as query parameter. For example: /v2/registry/docker-credentials?read_write=true

By default, the returned credentials will not expire. To retrieve credentials with an expiry set, expiry_seconds may be provided as a query parameter. For example: /v2/registry/docker-credentials?expiry_seconds=3600 will return credentials that expire after one hour.

The duration in seconds that the returned registry credentials will be valid. If not set or 0, the credentials will not expire.

By default, the registry credentials allow for read-only access. Set this query parameter to true to obtain read-write credentials.
