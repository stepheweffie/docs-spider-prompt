A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets, Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.

Tags have two attributes: a user defined name attribute and an embedded resources attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.

To list all of your tags, you can send a GET request to /v2/tags.

Number of items returned per page

To create a tag you can send a POST request to /v2/tags with a name attribute.

The name of the tag. Tags may contain letters, numbers, colons, dashes, and underscores. There is a limit of 255 characters per tag.

Note: Tag names are case stable, which means the capitalization you use when you first create a tag is canonical.

When working with tags in the API, you must use the tag's canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", the URL to add that tag to a resource would be https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/tags/PROD/resources (not /v2/tags/prod/resources).

Tagged resources in the control panel will always display the canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", you can tag resources in the control panel by entering "prod". The tag will still display with its canonical capitalization, "PROD".

The response will be a JSON object with a key called tag. The value of this will be a tag object containing the standard tag attributes
