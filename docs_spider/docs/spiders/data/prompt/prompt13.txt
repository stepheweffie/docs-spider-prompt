In order to perform SSL termination on load balancers, DigitalOcean offers two types of SSL certificate management:

Custom: User-generated certificates may be uploaded to DigitalOcean where they will be placed in a fully encrypted and isolated storage system.

Let's Encrypt: Certificates may be automatically generated by DigitalOcean utilizing an integration with Let's Encrypt, the free and open certificate authority. These certificates will also be automatically renewed as required.

To list all of the certificates available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/certificates.

Number of items returned per page

Which 'page' of paginated results to return.

The result will be a JSON object with a certificates key. This will be set to an array of certificate objects, each of which will contain the standard certificate attributes.

Unauthorized

To upload new SSL certificate which you have previously generated, send a POST request to /v2/certificates.

When uploading a user-generated certificate, the private_key, leaf_certificate, and optionally the certificate_chain attributes should be provided. The type must be set to custom.
