You may also wish to set some other variables now or as you go along. For example, you may wish to set the DROPLET_ID variable to one of your Droplet IDs since this will be used frequently in the API.

If you are following along, make sure you use a Droplet ID that you control so that your commands will execute correctly.

If you need access to the headers of a response through curl, you can pass the -i flag to display the header information along with the body. If you are only interested in the header, you can instead pass the -I flag, which will exclude the response body entirely.

There are two different ways to pass parameters in a request with the API.

When passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be passed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and values as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that you are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the Content-Type header to application/json. This ensures that your request is interpreted correctly.

When passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can be passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters would be embedded into the URI itself by appending a ? to the end of the URI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be separated with a &. Tools like curl can create the appropriate URI when given parameters and values; this can also be done using the -F flag and then passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the form of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an equal sign.

In order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.

CORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain that the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects like control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can send requests to an outside domain.

The procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions (other than GET requests) begins by sending a "preflight" request. This sets the Origin header and uses the OPTIONS method. The server will reply back with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The client then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed constraints.

This process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can use curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers that will be set to show the constraints are:

You should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers, because the browser will typically do all of the work for you.

In order to interact with the DigitalOcean API, you or your application must authenticate.

The DigitalOcean API handles this through OAuth, an open standard for authorization. OAuth allows you to delegate access to your account in full or in read-only mode.

You can generate an OAuth token by visiting the Apps & API section of the DigitalOcean control panel for your account.

An OAuth token functions as a complete authentication request. In effect, it acts as a substitute for a username and password pair.

Because of this, it is absolutely essential that you keep your OAuth tokens secure. In fact, upon generation, the web interface will only display each token a single time in order to prevent the token from being compromised.

DigitalOcean access tokens begin with an identifiable prefix in order to distinguish them from other similar tokens.

In order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type Authorization header containing your OAuth token. All requests must be made over HTTPS.

1-Click applications are pre-built Droplet images or Kubernetes apps with software, features, and configuration details already set up for you. They can be found in the DigitalOcean Marketplace.
