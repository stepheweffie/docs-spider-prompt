DigitalOcean Block Storage Volumes provide expanded storage capacity for your Droplets and can be moved between Droplets within a specific region.

Volumes function as raw block devices, meaning they appear to the operating system as locally attached storage which can be formatted using any file system supported by the OS. They may be created in sizes from 1GiB to 16TiB.

By sending requests to the /v2/volumes endpoint, you can list, create, or delete volumes as well as attach and detach them from Droplets

To list all of the block storage volumes available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/volumes.

The region may be provided as query parameter in order to restrict results to volumes available in a specific region. For example: /v2/volumes?region=nyc1

It is also possible to list volumes on your account that match a specified name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name as a query parameter to /v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME. Note: You can only create one volume per region with the same name.

It is also possible to retrieve information about a block storage volume by name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name and the region slug for the region it is located in as query parameters to /v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME&region=nyc1.
