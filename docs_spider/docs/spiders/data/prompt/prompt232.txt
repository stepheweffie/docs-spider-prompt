To delete a single node in a pool, send a DELETE request to /v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/node_pools/$NODE_POOL_ID/nodes/$NODE_ID.

Appending the skip_drain=1 query parameter to the request causes node draining to be skipped. Omitting the query parameter or setting its value to 0 carries out draining prior to deletion.

Appending the replace=1 query parameter to the request causes the node to be replaced by a new one after deletion. Omitting the query parameter or setting its value to 0 deletes without replacement.
