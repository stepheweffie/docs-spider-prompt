Rollback an app to a previous deployment. A new deployment will be created to perform the rollback. The app will be pinned to the rollback deployment preventing any new deployments from being created, either manually or through Auto Deploy on Push webhooks. To resume deployments, the rollback must be either committed or reverted.

It is recommended to use the Validate App Rollback endpoint to double check if the rollback is valid and if there are any warnings.

The ID of the deployment to rollback to.

Whether to skip pinning the rollback deployment. If false, the rollback deployment will be pinned and any new deployments including Auto Deploy on Push hooks will be disabled until the rollback is either manually committed or reverted via the CommitAppRollback or RevertAppRollback endpoints respectively. If true, the rollback will be immediately committed and the app will remain unpinned.

Check whether an app can be rolled back to a specific deployment. This endpoint can also be used to check if there are any warnings or validation conditions that will cause the rollback to proceed under unideal circumstances. For example, if a component must be rebuilt as part of the rollback causing it to take longer than usual.

The billing endpoints allow you to retrieve your account balance, invoices and billing history.

Balance: By sending requests to the /v2/customers/my/balance endpoint, you can retrieve the balance information for the requested customer account.

Invoices: Invoices are generated on the first of each month for every DigitalOcean customer. An invoice preview is generated daily, which can be accessed with the preview keyword in place of $INVOICE_UUID. To interact with invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at /v2/customers/my/invoices.
