Domain record resources are used to set or retrieve information about the individual DNS records configured for a domain. This allows you to build and manage DNS zone files by adding and modifying individual records for a domain.

The DigitalOcean DNS management interface allows you to configure the following DNS records:

To get a listing of all records configured for a domain, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records. The list of records returned can be filtered by using the name and type query parameters. For example, to only include A records for a domain, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?type=A. name must be a fully qualified record name. For example, to only include records matching sub.example.com, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?name=sub.example.com. Both name and type may be used together.

The name of the domain itself.

A fully qualified record name. For example, to only include records matching sub.example.com, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?name=sub.example.com.

The type of the DNS record. For example: A, CNAME, TXT, ...

Number of items returned per page

Which 'page' of paginated results to return.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called domain_records. The value of this will be an array of domain record objects, each of which contains the standard domain record attributes. For attributes that are not used by a specific record type, a value of null will be returned. For instance, all records other than SRV will have null for the weight and port attributes.

To create a new record to a domain, send a POST request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records.

The request must include all of the required fields for the domain record type being added.

See the attribute table for details regarding record types and their respective required attributes.

The name of the domain itself.

The type of the DNS record. For example: A, CNAME, TXT, ...

The host name, alias, or service being defined by the record.

Variable data depending on record type. For example, the "data" value for an A record would be the IPv4 address to which the domain will be mapped. For a CAA record, it would contain the domain name of the CA being granted permission to issue certificates.

The priority for SRV and MX records.

The port for SRV records.

This value is the time to live for the record, in seconds. This defines the time frame that clients can cache queried information before a refresh should be requested.

The weight for SRV records.

An unsigned integer between 0-255 used for CAA records.

The parameter tag for CAA records. Valid values are "issue", "issuewild", or "iodef"

The response body will be a JSON object with a key called domain_record. The value of this will be an object representing the new record. Attributes that are not applicable for the record type will be set to null. An id attribute is generated for each record as part of the object.
